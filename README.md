I am a driven, dedicated and energetic junior full stack developer, looking for a tech company where I can continue to learn and grow as a competent software developer. 

For the past few years I have been teaching myself to code and because writing code brings me immense personal satisfaction I decided to join Makers Academy to boost my programming knowledge. At Makers I learnt about the fundamentals of OOP, TDD, BDD as well as best practices and methodologies when it comes to writing well tested and clean code. 

My background is in the financial industry, sales and logistics where I learnt to work, communicate and collaborate with people from various departments, levels and walks of life.

**Tech Stack**: React, Redux, Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Sinatra, Rails, Bootstrap, Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress

# Skills

#### Quick Learner
I am a hungry learner who devours information about topics of interest with passion and energy.

At Makers I taught myself Ruby on Rails in one week and, together with my team, used it to build a fully tested and working clone of Facebook. 
For the end of course project I learned enough React, Cypress, Jest and Enzyme during a single weekend, to enable me to contribute in a meaningful way to my team’s project and goals. 

#### Collaborator 

I am a goal-oriented person that loves working with other developers to achieve a common goal.
At Makers Academy we often worked on different, challenging projects in teams and this proved to be the most valuable experience during the course. I am always comfortable finding my place in a team, actively listen to my colleagues ideas and I value open and friendly communication.

#### Inquisitive 
I love to learn and read about software development from all the available sources(Youtube, Medium etc). I often find myself on Google searching for new books about programming  to study from and to help me deepen my understanding. Here are some of the books I really enjoyed reading:

- *The Road to React*, *The Road to Redux* , *The Road to React with Firebase*  by Robin Wieruch,
- *Mastering React TDD* by Daniel Irvine,
- *Fluent Python* by Luciano Ramalho,
- *Deep Learning with Python* by Francois Chollet,
- *SQL for Mere Mortals* by John Viescas,
- *JavaScript the Definitive Guide* by David Flanagan,
- *JavaScript the Good Parts* by Douglas Crockford.

#### Adaptable 
I have lived in five regions, in three different countries, and have met and worked with people from all backgrounds. Every change brought something new to my life, along with new challenges and new opportunities.

# Hobbies

The Great Outdoors - I love being surrounded by nature and experience it in all its glory. I love camping from early spring till late in the season. Nothing compares with that feeling when you wake up in the morning in your tent surrounded by nature, either in a lovely camping site somewhere in rural France or somewhere high in the mountains.

Fitness become a hobby of mine as soon as I started to realize that probably I won't live forever as previously thought. I'm trying to train at least 3 times a week, anything from high intensity workouts, lifting weights, rowing on my WaterRower or cycling. 

Photography and travelling
